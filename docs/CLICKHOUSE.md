ClickHouse has replication and also **data distribution mechanisms**, but the exact solution depends on what you want:

### 1. **Replication (for HA & consistency)**

* ClickHouse supports **ReplicatedMergeTree** family of engines.
* These keep multiple replicas of the same data on different servers, coordinated by **ZooKeeper** (or the newer **ClickHouse Keeper**).
* Replication here is mainly for **fault tolerance and HA**, not necessarily for pulling remote data to your laptop.

### 2. **Data distribution / sharding**

* You can define **Distributed tables** that query multiple shards/replicas across a cluster.
* Queries are pushed to where the data lives, results aggregated back.
* Good for large datasets but doesn’t “mirror” everything locally.

### 3. **Local mirroring / offline copy**

If your real use case is:
👉 *"I have too much data in the cloud, but I want a **local replica** so I can query locally without hitting the cloud all the time"*

You have a few practical options:

* **Backup & Restore**

  * Use `BACKUP TABLE ... TO Disk('local_path')` on the remote, then `RESTORE` locally.
* **ClickHouse-copier**

  * A built-in tool for copying subsets or entire tables between clusters.
* **`clickhouse-client --query="SELECT ..."` piping to `clickhouse-client` locally**

  * Example:

    ```bash
    clickhouse-client --host=remote --query="SELECT * FROM big_table" \
    | clickhouse-client --host=localhost --query="INSERT INTO big_table FORMAT TabSeparated"
    ```
* **Table Engines**

  * You can create a **remote table engine** to access cloud data from local queries, and if needed, periodically **materialize** it into local storage.

### 4. **Cloud-to-local sync**

If your dataset updates continuously, you can:

* Use **materialized views** on the cloud side to export deltas.
* Stream inserts with **Kafka + ClickHouse Kafka engine**.
* Or schedule **incremental syncs** via `ALTER TABLE ... FETCH PARTITION` (pulling partitions from replica).

---

✅ So: ClickHouse does have **replication (HA)** and **copying tools**, but for your scenario (local mirror of cloud data for heavy querying), the practical approach is either:

* **Continuous replication (if you want exact mirror, needs Keeper setup)**
* **One-way sync/backup** using copier or manual inserts.

## 🔹 1. **Real-time replication (always in sync)**

This is what ClickHouse’s **ReplicatedMergeTree** engines are built for.

* You define your tables using `ReplicatedMergeTree` instead of `MergeTree`.
* Each replica (cloud or local) stores **exactly the same data**.
* Replication is coordinated by **ClickHouse Keeper / ZooKeeper**.

Example table definition:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mydb.events
(
    event_time DateTime,
    user_id UInt32,
    action String
)
ENGINE = ReplicatedMergeTree('/clickhouse/tables/{shard}/events', '{replica}')
ORDER BY (event_time, user_id);
```

* `'/clickhouse/tables/{shard}/events'` → replication path in Keeper
* `'{replica}'` → replica name (unique per server)

If your **local machine** is part of this cluster, it will pull data continuously and stay in sync.
⚠️ But note: running replication across cloud ↔ laptop can be heavy and requires a **persistent Keeper service accessible to both**.

---

## 🔹 2. **Periodic snapshots / offline copies**

If you don’t need 24/7 sync, just “bring data home” at intervals:

### a) **Backup & Restore**

On cloud:

```sql
BACKUP TABLE mydb.events TO Disk('s3', 'backup_path/');
```

On local:

```sql
RESTORE TABLE mydb.events FROM Disk('s3', 'backup_path/');
```

---

### b) **Fetch partitions**

If only new data matters, you can pull incremental partitions:

```sql
ALTER TABLE mydb.events FETCH PARTITION '2025-08-18' FROM 'replica_host:9000';
```

This grabs one partition from the remote replica and stores it locally.

---

### c) **ClickHouse-copier**

A tool for scheduled data copying between clusters. You can run it nightly to mirror tables from cloud to local.

---

### d) **Ad-hoc transfer via client**

```bash
clickhouse-client --host=remote --query="SELECT * FROM mydb.events WHERE event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY FORMAT Native" \
| clickhouse-client --host=localhost --query="INSERT INTO mydb.events FORMAT Native"
```

This streams only yesterday’s data and inserts locally.

---

✅ **Summary**

* If you want **always in sync** → set up **ReplicatedMergeTree** with a shared Keeper (heavier, but automatic).
* If you want **periodic sync** → use **Backups, FETCH PARTITION, or clickhouse-copier** (simpler, lower overhead).
