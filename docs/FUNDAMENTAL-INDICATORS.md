# Fundamental Crypto Bull/Bear Market Indicators

## Executive Summary

A quantitative fundamental analysis framework for cryptocurrency markets requires multi-dimensional data across sentiment, liquidity, macroeconomic, and blockchain metrics. This comprehensive approach combines traditional financial indicators with crypto-native metrics to identify market regime changes and bull/bear transitions.

The strategy focuses on leading indicators that precede price movements, with emphasis on institutional flows, regulatory sentiment, and network fundamentals. Data costs range from free (government APIs) to $50K+/month (premium institutional data), while engineering complexity varies from simple API calls to complex real-time streaming pipelines.

## Signal Aggregation Framework

Each indicator produces a normalized score (-1 to +1). The composite bull/bear signal uses weighted averaging:

- **Macro Economic**: 25% weight
- **Sentiment**: 20% weight  
- **On-Chain/Network**: 20% weight
- **Institutional Flow**: 20% weight
- **Derivatives/Liquidity**: 15% weight

**Bull Market Signal**: Composite score > 0.6 for 7+ consecutive days
**Bear Market Signal**: Composite score < -0.4 for 14+ consecutive days
**Neutral/Transition**: -0.4 to 0.6 range
